# MoneyRecognition01
Simple money classifier (It can classify 20zl and 10zl bills)
It uses pretrained Resnet18. The training dataset consist of less than 50 photos for each bill. I obtained the photos by using `Selenium` to get the data from `Google search by image`.
This was my first image classification project. I need to gather more data and will attempt to make a classifier that recognizes 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 bills.
